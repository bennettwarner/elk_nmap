# Elastic stack (ELK) on Docker for the Ingest of NMAP scan results

based entirely on the awesome work from:

    https://github.com/deviantony/
    https://github.com/ChrisRimondi
    https://github.com/marco-lancini

Changes from @marco-lancini's repo include bumping up to a current version of the ELK stack and a refactor of the python ingestor to include the hostscript attribute from scans.
